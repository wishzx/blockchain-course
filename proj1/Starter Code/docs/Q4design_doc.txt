# TODO: Write a short (1-3 paragraph) design document about your solution to Q4.
#       Please include the following:
#     
#         1) An explanation of what you wrote and how the ScriptPubKey works
#               
                To redeem this script you need always the recipient signature, but there are 2 way to finish the validation.
                The first method is by providing the secret x that must correspond to the provided hash.
                The other way is if both parties agreed so you also need to provide the signature of the sender.



#         2) Briefly, how the ScriptPubKey you wrote fits into the bigger 
#            picture of this atomic swap.

                To make this swap atomic you need to provide a way for both parties to go back if something wrong happens. This script is first used by Alice while creating
                a timelocked transaction signed by both. The timelocked transaction allow her to get back the coins if something goes wrong so now she can broadcast it.

                Now Bob must do the opposite, protecting himself with a shorter timelock because otherwise Alice can wait her timelock to expire and claim both his and her coins.
                When he has the timelock transaction signed he can publish his ScriptPubKey and now Alice can redeem it revealing the secret key so that he can reedem too.


#         3) Consider the case of Alice sending coins to Bob with coinExchangeScript:
#            Why can Alice always get her money back if Bob doesn't redeem it? 
#            Why can't this be solved with a simple 1-of-2 multisig? 
#
            Because Alice owns a transaction signed by both of them (so it can redeem it using condition 2 explained above) but is timelocked (for Bob protection). So after the timelock
            Alice can always get back the money unless bob get to know the secret (which he can't unless Alice tell him)

            I assume you meant 1-of-2 multisig instead of both signature. In that case Alice can just sign a non timelocked transaction and steal the money as soon as Bob publish his transaction.
